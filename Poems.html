				<h1>Strategic, By <a href="Authors.html">Sheila Maldonado</a></h1>
				<p>I’m from the monitor in the middle of the Americas<br> I am 
					a monitor in the middle of the Americas<br> I monitor the Americas screen 
					American<br> a scream through a screen<br> I see unseen I’m seen obscene 
					a scene<br> I am a screen on a seam a fault a flaw fluid fixed followed 
					forgotten forgetting fall<br> in the fault<br> I’m the monitor the 
					monster the scream

				<h1>Emily Dickinson at the Poetry Slam, By <a href="Authors.html">Dan Vera</a></h1>
				<p>
					I will tell you why she rarely ventured from her house. <br>
					It happened like this:<br>
					<br>
					One day she took the train to Boston,<br>
					made her way to the darkened room,<br>
					put her name down in cursive script<br>
					and waited her turn. <br>
					<br>
					When they read her name aloud<br>
					she made her way to the stage<br>
					straightened the papers in her hands —<br>
					pages and envelopes, the backs of grocery bills,<br>
					she closed her eyes for a minute,<br>
					took a breath, <br>
					and began. <br>
					<br>
					From her mouth perfect words exploded,<br>
					intact formulas of light and darkness.<br>
					She dared to rhyme with words like cochineal<br>
					and described the skies like diadem.<br> 
					Obscurely worded incantations filled the room<br>
					with an alchemy that made the very molecules quake.<br>
					<br>
					The solitary words she handled<br>
					in her upstairs room with keen precision<br>
					came rumbling out to make the electric lights flicker.<br>
					<br>
					40 members of the audience<br> 
					were treated for hypertension.<br>
					20 year old dark haired beauties found their heads<br>
					had turned a Moses White.<br>
					<br>
					Her second poem erased the memory of every cellphone<br>
					in the nightclub,<br>
					and by the fourth line of the sixth verse<br>
					the grandmother in the upstairs apartment <br>
					had been cured of her rheumatism.<br> 
					<br>
					The papers reported the power outages.<br> 
					The area hospitals taxed their emergency generators<br>
					and sirens were heard to wail through the night.<br>
					<br>
					Quietly she made her way to the exit,<br>
					walked to the terminal and rode back to Amherst.<br> 
					<br>
					She never left her room again<br>
					and never read such syllables aloud.<br>
				</p>

				<h1>After “Killers of the Flower Moon”, By <a href="Authors.html">Elise Paschen</a></h1>
				<p>
					Lily Gladstone confides she wore my great<br>
					grandmother Eliza’s blankets in three scenes.<br>
					<br>
					I don’t remember my great grandmother, though<br>
					in a photo, aged ninety, she holds me in her arms.<br>
					<br>
					The actress plays Mollie Burkhart, who lived<br>
					down the street from Eliza in Fairfax.<br>
					<br>
					Hands out wide, Lily says Eliza had a broad wingspan.<br>
					She pleated the wool broadcloth several times.<br>
					<br>
					Through an open window, wings outstretched, an eagle<br>
					owl looms toward Mollie’s mother, dying from poison.<br>
					<br>
					My mother told me that owls in trees wailed<br>
					the windswept night before her father died.<br>
					<br>
					Wrapping my great grandmother’s striped blanket<br>
					around her shoulders, Mollie asks her husband,<br>
					<br>
					during a downpour, not to close the window.<br>
					Be still, she says, and listen to the rain.<br>
					<br>
					Eliza’s blankets fold and unfold stories.<br>
					Into every pattern, I fly back home.<br>
					<br>
					The Osage replaced hide robes with Dutch-<br>
					traded blankets in the mid-19th century.<br>
					<br>
					I stop breathing during the night of film<br>
					when a murderer calls Osage women blankets.<br>
					<br>
					While her husband injects Mollie with arsenic,<br>
					each sister is shot, poisoned, or bombed to death.<br>
					<br>
					A woman, in a voice-over, foreshadows,<br>
					this blanket is a target on our backs.<br>
					<br>
					In the quiet, after Mollie’s obituary<br>
					is reported, I only hear rain.<br>
					<br>
					Outside the theater, silent thunderbirds<br>
					overhead spread dark cloud-spattered wings,<br>
					<br>
					outlining circles across a broadcloth.<br>
					Inside each target, a hole in the sky.<br>
				</p>

				<h1>By Candlelight, By <a href="Authors.html">Edith Sitwell</a></h1>
				<p>
					Houses red as flower of bean,<br>
					Flickering leaves and shadows lean!<br>
					Pantalone, like a parrot,<br>
					Sat and grumbled in the garret—<br>
					Sat and growled and grumbled till<br>
					Moon upon the window-sill<br>
					Like a red geranium<br>
					Scented his bald cranium.<br>
					Said Brighella, meaning well:<br>
					“Pack your box and—go to Hell!<br>
					Heat will cure your rheumatism!” . . .<br>
					Silence crowned this optimism—<br>
					Not a sound and not a wail:<br>
					But the fire (lush leafy vales)<br>
					Watched the angry feathers fly.<br>
					Pantalone ’gan to cry—<br>
					Could not, would not, pack his box!<br>
					Shadows (curtseying hens and cocks)<br>
					Pecking in the attic gloom<br>
					Tried to smother his tail-plume . . .<br>
					Till a cockscomb candle-flame<br>
					Crowing loudly, died: Dawn came.<br>
				</p>

				<h1>Nothing Gold Can Stay, By <a href="Authors.html">Robert Frost</a></h1>
				<p>
					Nature’s first green is gold,<br>
					Her hardest hue to hold.<br>
					Her early leaf’s a flower;<br>
					But only so an hour.<br>
					Then leaf subsides to leaf.<br>
					So Eden sank to grief,<br>
					So dawn goes down to day.<br>
					Nothing gold can stay.<br>
